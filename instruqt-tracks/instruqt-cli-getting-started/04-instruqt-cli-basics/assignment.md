</style>Let's try a few basic commands. The first one you've already seen:

```bash
instruqt -h
```

When you add an `-h` flag it will show more information about the command or subcommand.

Check your command line configuration settings:

```bash
instruqt config list
```

This command will show all the configuration properties of the CLI, including your current default organization. Take a moment to confirm that you have configured the correct organization with the CLI.

You can view the version of the Instruqt CLI with this command:

```bash
instruqt version
```

Next let's check for updates:

```bash
instruqt update
```

The Instruqt CLI can automatically update itself on most systems. It automatically checks for new versions each time you start it up.

Now that you have a feel for the command line tool, let's create our first track. Hit the **Next** button below to proceed.
